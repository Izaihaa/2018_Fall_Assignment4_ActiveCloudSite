    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        This assignment was the most difficult one for us to complete. 
        We believe that is because this assignment attempted to introduced
        3 major components to our skills repertoire. It attempted to make us 
        familiar with the MVC model, API’s and Azure SQL Databases all 
        simultaneously. Moving forward, it may be best to have this assignment 
        broken up into to the separate pieces to allow for more time to become 
        familiar with the concepts. Particularly our team spent the most time 
        attempting to adjust the pre-given code to allow for all the IEX stock 
        symbols to be saved to the database. As we progressed, we determined 
        that if we reduced the overall list to aprox. 1000 stocks, we were able 
        to convert and save the list to the database. Although this isn’t ideal, 
        we were unable to resolve the issue.

    <h3>Stock Picking Strategy</h3>
    <p>
        Our group decided to go with the Cash ROIC Strategy. This strategy 
        focuses heavily on reviewing a companies cash flows. Rather than 
        picking stocks based on a companies cash generated by all sources 
        such as financing or investing, this strategy focuses on the cash 
        that the companies real business generated. A good way to pick 
        strategies is to compare the free cash flow of a company to the 
        capital amount invested.
